# :material-wifi-plus: Networking

Networking can be set up on any device that can connect to the internet (this includes devices with native networking capabilites and ones where networking can be added through an external dongle).  

With networking turned on you do things such as [add games](../../play/add-games), [update JELOS](../../play/update), [netplay across devices](../../play/netplay), [cloud sync](../cloud-sync), [play over VPN](../vpn) and access [RetroAchievements](../../play/retro-achievements/).

## Setup

1. While in EmulationStation press ++"START"++ on your controller to open the Main Menu.
2. Navigate to and select `Network Settings`.
3. Under the Network Configuration header turn on `Enable Network`.
4. Then select `WIFI SSID` and choose your network name.
5. Finally enter your password under `WIFI Key` using the onscreen keyboard.

When you exit the network settings menu your network should activiate.

## Additional Notes

- If you want to transfer games over the network make sure to turn enable SSH and Samba under `Network Services`.  You can read more about that on the [Add Games](../../play/add-games) page.
- If you want to enable netplay to be able to play multiplayer across devices please see the page on [Netplay](../../play/netplay).
- Check out [Cloud Sync](../cloud-sync) to see the available options and steps for setting up cloud sync services.
- If you would like to earn achievements while playing games please check out [RetroAchievements](../../play/retro-achievements/)
