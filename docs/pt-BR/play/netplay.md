## Enabling Network Play

Before netplay is available, it must be enabled on each participating device.

* Select Games Settings -> Netplay Settings
  * NetPlay -> Enabled
  * Index Games

## Option 1: LAN based Network Play
Using this feature is simple.  For LAN based play, connect your devices to your WIFI network.  A minimum of one host and one client are required for play.

## Option 2: Device to Device Network Play

Device to device connections will automatically generate and connect to a local WIFI network.  As with LAN based play, one host and one client are required for play.
